                A common fallacy in programming is to pick a langauge and use it for everything.
                Think of each programming language as a tool, where each tool is good for a set of things
                and not so good for other things. A good programmer would pick the right tool for the job!

                First, there are different <i>types</i> of programming. Each of these genres of types of programming
                is called a <i>paradigm</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Different paradigms encapsulate different ways of thinking about a problem,
                which naturally have different strengths and weaknesses.
                Imperative programming represents the solution to a problem as a list of steps to solve it, while
                declarative programming represents a solution as a composition of smaller sub-problems.

                Python is good for some applications, but bad for others. 
                As you'll note on the chart, it's interpreted and dynamically typed, which is good for prototyping.
                Its slow speed and memory inefficiency make it a bad candidate for large projects.

                Choosing the right language for the job is <i>crucial</i> to good design.
                As above, Python is not a good candidate for large-scale computationally-intensive programs.
                For cases like this, a language like C++.

                language that is simple to develop and deploy. Many people consider

            Python is a slow language compared to lower level languages like C++ and even Java. Python’s container based typing system is memory intensive. Python is not well suited for parallel processing and struggles at large scale data processing. This makes Python an all around poor choice for lower-level systems based tasks and a questionable option for large scale deployment. Perhaps the real reason so many older programmers and traditionalists do not like Python is because the language does so much of the hard work for you. While this is convenient, it means where other languages would force the user to contend with some in depth coding principals python simply handles them behind the scenes. This makes aforementioned old school programmers upset because they most definitely had to contend with these difficult topics and feel that everyone else should as well.
            <br><br>
            This is not to say this viewpoint is entirely wrong.
            Topics like memory management, typing, and parallelization are important in Computer Programming and should not be ignored.
